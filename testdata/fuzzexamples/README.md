# SDK Fuzz and Examples fixtures

These workloads and their assertions come from DataDog/dd-trace-go PR #5442
at `7b32e1812cb5c1fb807a63cc5042750f3d3cd672`. [SOURCE.json](SOURCE.json)
records every original path, original hash and local hash. [LICENSE](LICENSE)
is the upstream Apache-2.0 license.

The integration harness copies these sources into isolated SDK and Mini modules.
It relocates helper imports; Mini also relocates runtime imports. The mock intake
exports wire events and optional coverage observations. Covered variants add a
production helper and calls to it without changing the original assertions.
The runtime, workloads and original expectations remain separate from the
wire comparator. See [Fuzz and Examples](../../docs/fuzz-examples.md) for cases,
commands and update checks.
