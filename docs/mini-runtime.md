# Mini runtime configuration and API

Mini is the default CI Visibility runtime used by `ddtest`. It retains the
SDK's testing policies and writes native CI events without importing the APM
tracer. Use the [README](../README.md) for installation and common commands.

`--runtime=sdk` selects the unchanged SDK at the version pinned in
[`internal/version`](../internal/version/version.go). Mini can coexist with an
application's SDK imports; those imports still contribute their normal build
dependencies. [SDK span copies](sdk-span-mirror.md) explain how the two runtimes
associate operations without changing APM parentage.

## Configuration

Set these variables in the environment of `ddtest`, or of a compiled test binary:

| Variable | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `DD_CIVISIBILITY_ENABLED` | The CLI sets `parent` only when absent. Explicit values, including empty and `false`, are retained. Standalone test binaries need activation explicitly. |
| `DD_CIVISIBILITY_AGENTLESS_ENABLED` | Defaults to `false`. Set `true` to send directly to the CI intake. |
| `DD_API_KEY` | Required for Agentless HTTP delivery. Supply it through your secret configuration. |
| `DD_SITE` | Datadog site for Agentless endpoints; defaults to `datadoghq.com`. |
| `DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL` | Explicit Agent address, including supported Unix socket URLs. Without an override, host/port settings take precedence over the default socket, then `http://localhost:8126`. [Agent settings](../README.md#reporting-and-delivery) |
| `DD_SERVICE` | Explicit test service. A nonempty value takes precedence over automatic naming. |
| `DD_ENV`, `DD_VERSION`, `DD_TAGS` | Environment, service version and custom tags on CI events. |
| `DD_TEST_SESSION_NAME` | Explicit session name, including an explicitly empty value. Otherwise use the CI job name plus test command, or the command alone. |
| `DD_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`, `DD_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` | Override Git identity. Both are needed to fetch settings when the checkout/CI environment cannot supply them. |
| `DD_TRACE_DEBUG` | Build and runtime diagnostics with phase and request timings. [Log guide](cli-debug.md) |
| `DD_CIVISIBILITY_LOGS_ENABLED` | Enable CI log delivery. |
| `DD_CIVISIBILITY_DEFERRED_DELIVERY` | Default `false`; send queued data between completed test groups when `true`. [Delivery contract](delivery.md) |
| `DD_CIVISIBILITY_SERVICE_FROM_CODEOWNERS` | Default `false`; derive package services when there is no explicit service. [Configuration](codeowners-service.md) |
| `DD_CIVISIBILITY_SERVICE_FROM_CODEOWNERS_FORMAT` | Default `service-$(owner)`; quote the literal token in shell commands. |

Feature requests determine retries, EFD, ITR, impacted tests, coverage upload
and test-management policies. Their environment overrides and combinations are
checked in the [feature matrix](ci-parity.md). Mini reads configuration from the
environment; APM YAML/Fleet configuration is excluded.

Each test binary initializes its own CI runtime, including settings and
telemetry, then flushes at session close. A multi-package command can therefore
have several sessions and independent network startup/shutdown costs. Settings
and initial telemetry overlap and finish before tests are admitted. Delivery
failures are logged without replacing the Go command's result.

## Runtime provisioning

For an ordinary module, no persistent runtime requirement is needed. If the
runtime is absent, `ddtest` provides it through temporary copies of the effective
`go.mod` and `go.sum`, passed to Go with `-modfile`. Explicit modfiles and their
overlays are respected. Runtime provisioning does not edit the client's files;
`-mod=mod` can still permit Go's native package query to make its own edits.

Mini honors a client `replace` first. Otherwise it uses the source location
recorded when the CLI was built: a checkout or the exact cached module used by
`go install`. A checkout supplies its current contents, including edits made
after building the CLI. Keep the CLI and runtime at the same revision because
their private testing hooks must agree.

With `-trimpath`, or when that source directory is missing, the CLI checks the
module cache for its exact published version. It fetches that version only when
no usable local copy exists. Required `go get` commands announce themselves and
stream Go's diagnostics on `stderr`. The CLI never searches other checkouts or
substitutes a different cached version. A development binary with neither
sources nor a published version needs a client replacement.

Use a Go toolchain installed outside `GOMODCACHE`; Go prohibits overlays within
that cache, including downloaded toolchains. Mini requires Go 1.25 or newer;
preparation checks the toolchain selected by Go. A client declaring Go 1.21
keeps that language version, including its loop-variable semantics and timer
defaults. A module without a `go` directive keeps Go 1.16 semantics and
GODEBUG defaults, as with native Go. For older client languages, Mini becomes a
separate main module in a temporary workspace. The client's module files stay
unchanged except for updates its own `-mod=mod` imports would require under
native Go.

The temporary `go.work`, and the `GOFLAGS` adapted for it, apply only to the
`go test` command that `ddtest` starts. Mini's `internal/goenv` package
restores the caller's `GOWORK` and `GOFLAGS` in the test process. It imports
only `syscall` and its path sorts before `os`, so Go initializes it before any
package that can start a command, including dependencies that do not import
`testing`. Commands started by tests, or by those dependencies, see the same
module, workspace and flags as under native `go test`.

Mini uses native Go 1.25 APIs. `internal/compat` contains only `AsType` and
`Pointer`, which adapt Go 1.26 helpers used by the incorporated sources. The
distributed module has no external requirements, including test requirements.
CI checks Go 1.25, 1.26, 1.27 and a recorded tip revision. The full SDK reference
requires Go 1.26. Go 1.25 and tip have a native Mini feature suite; tip also
checks manual SDK span copies. The frozen Orchestrion reference fails on tip,
so its complete differential comparisons run on Go 1.26/1.27.

The SDK backend provides its pinned version with `go get`. A different selected
or replaced SDK is rejected. Mini's application-SDK integration has separate
[private-layout checks](sdk-span-mirror.md#maintenance-and-checks).

### Vendor mode and workspaces

Mini can be supplied without a persistent requirement in these modes. A
workspace run uses a temporary `go.work` with absolute `use` and local
replacement paths. The effective Mini sources become a main module in that
workspace. Existing requirements and local or remote replacements retain their
selected sources; absent runtimes use the CLI sources or its exact published
version. The original workspace, checksums and module files stay unchanged.

For a module using `vendor`, a temporary workspace contains the client and Mini.
Go reads a workspace's vendor directory next to its `go.work`, and reads
`vendor/modules.txt` outside the overlay. That manifest is the only copied file:
it gains the workspace header. Every other top-level vendor entry is a symbolic
link to the client's tree, so nothing else is copied and local patches stay live.
Alternate modfiles keep working in any spelling, including `GOFLAGS`.

The workspace lives in the user cache, under `ddtest/vendor-workspaces`, at a
path derived from its `go.work`, manifest and linked entries. Go's build cache
keys include each package directory, so this stable path lets unchanged vendored
packages reuse compiled archives between runs. A changed manifest or workspace
selects a new path. A run holds a shared lock on its workspace until `go test`
exits. When a new workspace is created, entries unused for 14 days are removed,
but only while their lock can be taken exclusively without waiting; a workspace
in use is never removed. A run that waited while another removed its workspace
rebuilds it. Removal never follows the links, and deleting the directory by hand
is safe when no `ddtest` run is active.
Without a usable user cache, the links live in the run's temporary directory.
Without symbolic links, as on Windows without the required privilege, files are
hard-linked or copied there instead. The original vendor tree is never edited. Native Go still
reports inconsistent vendor metadata rather than silently selecting other
versions. An already vendored Mini can continue using its existing sources.

Mini's runtime, CLI and ported SDK test helpers use only the standard library
and this module. [Consumer checks](maintenance.md#verification-before-publication)
verify that `go mod tidy` adds no external modules and that old client dependency
versions are retained.

## Test context and propagation

`testopt.Context(t)` returns the active Mini context with native testing
cancellation and values. Each subtest has its own identity. Uninstrumented tests
and isolated process-retry children have no local Mini identity; the retry
controller reconstructs those children's test events.

```go
import (
    "net/http"
    "testing"

    "github.com/tonyredondo/dd-ci-testing-poc/propagation"
    "github.com/tonyredondo/dd-ci-testing-poc/testopt"
)

func TestRequest(t *testing.T) {
    headers := http.Header{}
    if identity, ok := propagation.FromContext(testopt.Context(t)); ok {
        if err := propagation.Inject(identity, headers, propagation.W3C); err != nil {
            t.Fatal(err)
        }
    }
    // Attach headers to the integration-test request.
}
```

W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate` and Datadog headers carry the full 128-bit trace ID
and active span ID. Generated span IDs use 63 bits, as in the SDK. Sampling
priority is propagation metadata; Mini records every CI event.

For a receiving APM tracer to use that identity, extract the carrier with its
own API. Its private context value differs from Mini's. In a combined binary,
`t.Context()` also carries Mini identity when SDK mirror hooks are installed.
Passing it to `tracer.StartSpanFromContext` creates an independent CI copy while
the original APM span keeps its own trace. See [SDK span association](sdk-span-mirror.md).

## Explicit clients and manual instrumentation

`testopt.New(Config)` creates an independent client with explicit service,
tags, transport, batch capacity and timeout. It does not read API credentials
from the environment. `Client.StartSpan` accepts a context and event options;
`ResourceName`, `SpanType`, `StartTime` and `Tag` set its fields. Numeric tags
become metrics, and errors retain the SDK's tag semantics.

`Finish` seals a span once. Setters then become no-ops, getters remain available
and repeated finishes do not enqueue again. `Flush` and `Close` return delivery
errors; `LastError` and `DroppedEvents` expose delivery state. A failed flush
keeps its batch while open. A terminal close can abandon the batch and reports
that failure. The caller owns an explicit client's lifetime and must close it.
[Event ownership](architecture.md#native-event-ownership) documents the limits.

For manual testing entrypoints, `testopt.RunM(m)` instruments `TestMain`, and
`testopt.GetFuzz(f).Fuzz(callback)` wraps a native fuzz callback. Automatic builds
recognize these hooks and avoid duplicate events. [Manual fuzz usage](fuzz-examples.md#manual-entrypoints)
shows the code. The API is experimental and can change before a release.

## Delivery and offline output

Test-cycle events use MessagePack envelope version 1, test-event version 2,
and session/module/suite version 1. Batches have a 5 MiB uncompressed limit and
a 2.5 MiB flush threshold. Agentless delivery uses standard gzip at
`gzip.BestSpeed`; Agent delivery uses the EVP v2 proxy. Coverage and CI telemetry
use their own SDK-derived writers. [Delivery](delivery.md) explains retries,
queue bounds, deferred groups, leak checks and payload metadata.

Bazel payload-file mode writes JSON under
`TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR/payloads/tests/`, with corresponding coverage and
telemetry directories. Manifest mode uses the SDK's offline read cache. The
test-cycle file writer needs no HTTP credentials and sends no event requests;
the settings-cache reader still requires a nonempty API key. The offline
comparison uses a synthetic key and checks that no HTTP request is sent.
This is evidence for the file contract, not an actual Bazel build.

Mini retains CI telemetry and diagnostics. It excludes APM sampling, profiling,
security, remote configuration, heartbeats and dependency/endpoint inventories.
A telemetry URL containing `apmtelemetry` is shared infrastructure and does not
mean Mini has started an APM tracer.

## Source locations and compatibility

Mini uses a confirmed named function's parsed declaration for its source range.
The runtime entry line identifies the function but can point at its closing
brace after optimization. If source cannot be read or matched, that runtime line
remains the fallback. Anonymous functions have separate matching rules.

The pinned SDK can report an optimized test declared on lines 5–10 as 10–10;
Mini reports 5–10. Regression tests check original source lines directly.
Cleanup-only coverage and duplicate Testify method identity also have direct
Mini regression tests. The [comparison contract](ci-parity.md#comparison-contract)
records these deliberate differences and its normalization rules.

The [validation guide](validation.md) lists loopback wire checks, imported SDK
assertions, concurrency and platform coverage. Current workflow results are
evidence for their exact inputs. Live intake/UI acceptance, real Bazel execution
and long-running fuzz campaigns need separate validation. The
[benchmark report](benchmarks.md) retains timings for its recorded revision.
