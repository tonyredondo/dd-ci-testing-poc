# Delivery checkpoints and goleak

These features belong to Mini. The `sdk` backend keeps the upstream SDK's
delivery behavior. Neither feature adds a runtime module dependency.

## Deferred delivery

Set `DD_CIVISIBILITY_DEFERRED_DELIVERY=true` before running the test binary:

```sh
DD_CIVISIBILITY_DEFERRED_DELIVERY=true ddtest test --runtime=mini -count=1 ./...
```

The default is ordinary delivery: finishing an event never waits for the
network, and a background sender delivers full batches. With the variable
enabled, delivery runs between completed test groups, and remaining data is sent
at session close. Sequential tests can have a delivery checkpoint after each
test. Parallel tests continue together until the whole group finishes; the next
group waits while delivery completes.

Deferred mode buffers test-cycle events, coverage and diagnostic logs while
instrumented tests are active, and sends nothing concurrently with them. A test holds
an activity lease through its body, cleanup callbacks and parallel descendants.
The lease is acquired inside the existing instrumented function, preserving the
SDK's function-identity checks and retry accounting.

```mermaid

    participant Test as Instrumented tests
    participant Idle as Idle coordinator
    participant Send as CI writers
    Test->>Idle: Admit test
    Test->>Send: Finish events and queue side payloads
    Note over Idle,Send: No delivery while admitted tests remain
    Test->>Idle: Last test cleanup releases lease
    Idle->>Send: Deliver full batches synchronously
    Note over Idle: Next test waits at admission
    Send-->>Idle: Delivery completes or fails
    Idle-->>Test: Admit next test
```

Nested tests and concurrent retry attempts use the same process-wide coordinator.
Waiting for delivery inside an active group would deadlock the test scheduler.
The coordinator starts no goroutines. Initial CI settings and repository
upload run synchronously in this mode. In both modes, telemetry prepares and
queues `app-started` without HTTP. It sends after the first admitted group has
finished, including user cleanups and parallel descendants. The first test does
not wait for that request; the next group waits while it completes. If no tests
run, session close sends it before `app-closing`. Deferred delivery also replaces
the periodic telemetry worker with idle checkpoints, which flush only once its
interval has elapsed.

A checkpoint delivers only full payloads: sealed test-cycle batches (the event
count or 2.5 MiB threshold) and full coverage/log payloads. Partial payloads
wait for the end of the session, so a serial suite sends one payload per full
batch rather than one per test.

Coverage counter snapshots are captured in the before/after hooks. Deferred
delivery postpones their processing as well as their upload until the whole
test group is idle. It never captures counters from a later test. In ordinary
delivery, processing finishes in the after hook when telemetry or debug logging
needs wall-clock timestamps; with both disabled it runs asynchronously.
Completed coverage workers exit before session shutdown. Serialization durations
use a monotonic origin, while event timestamps keep their wall-clock meaning.

The queued startup payload retains its initialization timestamp and configuration.
The native telemetry timer stays stopped until that first flush completes;
interval adjustments cannot start it early. Periodic telemetry cannot bypass the
queued startup. Failed requests retain the payload for retry
under the existing endpoint and queue rules. Startup sends create no new worker.
Ordinary mode coordinates admission only while startup is pending, then permits
periodic telemetry and CI sends during tests. Use deferred delivery to keep all
queued processing and sends outside admitted test groups.

Each telemetry response is consumed and closed before its flush returns, including
error responses before endpoint fallback. The configured client timeouts bound
HTTP completion. Delayed startup telemetry may be lost if the process terminates
without reaching a checkpoint or normal shutdown. This changes delivery timing,
not the event contents or the settings needed to choose test features.

This trades memory and delivery latency for isolation from test bodies. The
pending queue can grow throughout a parallel group; its total memory is not
bounded by `MaxEvents`. Each outgoing test-cycle payload still obeys the event
count limit, 2.5 MiB flush threshold and 5 MiB uncompressed intake limit. A failed
flush preserves unsent chunks in order. Successfully sent chunks are not retried.
Final abandonment reports drops per payload, not per event.

An explicit `Flush` during an active test returns without waiting for that test;
the next checkpoint then also delivers the partial test-cycle batch. `Close` is terminal and flushes
directly. Panic and signal shutdown force a checkpoint so writer shutdown can
join pending batches. A user-created explicit client therefore remains responsible
for its `Close` timing. Deferred mode is not a guarantee that no goroutine exists
in the test process: CI still installs its signal handler, and tests may start
their own workers.

## Automatic goleak integration

When the selected Mini test graph reaches `go.uber.org/goleak`, `ddtest` prepares
its `Find` entry. This is automatic in both ordinary and deferred delivery.
Calling `VerifyNone`, `VerifyTestMain` or a helper in another module reaches that
same entry. An unused requirement in `go.mod` does not activate the integration.
The minimum supported version is v1.3.0, the first with `IgnoreAnyFunction`;
v2 needs a separate review. Preparation checks the selected version and entry
signature before a warm cache can skip compilation. The current version fixture
uses v1.3.0. An unsupported version or entry produces a warning and the build
continues without the integration; its leak checks can then report CI workers.

```mermaid

    Find["goleak Find"] --> Wait["Wait for active CI sends"]
    Wait --> Pause["Pause new CI sends"]
    Pause --> Close["Close owned idle CI connections"]
    Close --> Check["Run original goleak checks"]
    Check --> Resume["Resume CI sends on return"]
```

The shim adds exact function filters for the CI signal handler, telemetry ticker,
blocked CI senders, Mini's background test-cycle sender, diagnostic log sender
and coverage sender. It preserves the
caller's options and goleak's original validation, retry loop and error result.
Waiting for an active CI request can add its remaining HTTP/retry time before
goleak starts that loop; the checkpoint waits for delivery rather than canceling it.
It also waits, for up to one minute like the SDK's own end-of-session wait, for
the asynchronous settings start-up and repository upload, including their git
subprocesses, which would otherwise look like leaks.
It does not use `IgnoreCurrent`, ignore `net/http` functions, or suppress arbitrary
goroutine snapshots. Standard HTTP transports are cloned for Mini's ownership;
closing them does not close the caller's default transport. Custom RoundTrippers
are not closed by leak checkpoints; they retain their own lifecycle and may
require caller-managed cleanup.

`VerifyNone` itself cannot assign other parallel tests' goroutines to their owners.
Use `VerifyTestMain` for a parallel suite, following goleak's normal contract.
This shim excludes CI workers; it does not change that limitation or forgive test
leaks. Integration tests include a blocked test goroutine and a user-owned idle
HTTP connection as negative controls.

## Tool dispatch and cache identity

Go rejects overlays beneath `GOMODCACHE`, so goleak uses the existing selective
compiler wrapper. One shared graph query discovers Testify and goleak, including
external helpers. Builds needing neither library nor the coverage bridge omit
`-toolexec`. Unrelated tools bypass plan loading; compiler and linker version
probes keep Go's native identity.

Testify's fingerprint travels through `testing` export data. Goleak does not
import `testing`, so its prepared source and hook are hashed into a package-only
`-gcflags=go.uber.org/goleak=...` sentinel import directory. Go supplies imports
through `-importcfg`, so the sentinel is not read. Existing applicable user
compiler flags are retained. Only goleak's action key needs this additional marker;
there is no persistent POC cache. Covered goleak inputs are edited after Go's
coverage generation, preserving the original coverage layout.

## Payload-level common metadata

Mini writes test-cycle envelope metadata. The `"*"` entry contains
`language`, `runtime-id`, `library_version` and, when configured, `env`.
Event-kind entries carry `test_session.name`. This applies defaults across a
payload without copying those strings into every event.

CI, Git, OS and runtime strings share an immutable base across CI spans.
This includes `ci.*`, `git.*`, `os.*`, `runtime.*` and `_dd.ci.env_vars`. Getters
read an event's own value first, then that base. A numeric override masks the
base; later text replaces the metric. Finishing an event seals its local maps
without copying or changing the common snapshot.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CI["CI and Git tags"] --> Snapshot["Owned immutable snapshot"]
    Snapshot --> Span["Shared base and local overrides"]
    Span --> Getter["Effective getter value"]
    Span --> Batch["Check batch compatibility"]
    Batch --> Common["Defaults by event kind"]
    Batch --> Local["Local overrides and fallback tags"]
    Common --> Payload["Test-cycle payload"]
    Local --> Payload
```

At delivery, homogeneous test/session/module/suite events use their event-kind
metadata entry. CI fields stay out of `"*"`, so ordinary child spans do not gain
CI tags. An override stays on its event and takes precedence. If any event
overrides a common key with text or a metric, that key stays out of the new
defaults for its kind in that batch. Peers carry the string locally instead.
This avoids numeric inheritance and excludes an unused original string from the
payload and its byte budget, even when the original value was very large.
Different snapshots or an event with no shared base trigger the same local
fallback for that event kind; other kinds can still share their defaults.

The SDK's tag API publishes updates through `AddCITags` and `AddCITagsMap`, and
also exposes a mutable cached map. Snapshot lookup compares current
contents, so sequential direct edits and resets are seen too. A changed snapshot
gets a new revision; cached, UTF-8-truncated options are rebuilt once. Existing
spans keep their old values, including when later feature discovery changes tags.
Concurrent direct writes to the exposed SDK map remain unsupported; use its
synchronized update APIs.

Bazel payload-file mode applies its CI/Git/OS/runtime filter before a shared base
is created. Numeric metrics, hierarchy IDs, capabilities and test-specific tags
keep their existing fields. Byte accounting includes the shared strings and
envelope overhead conservatively; repeated values can shrink the actual payload
without bypassing its uncompressed limit. Projection never mutates a sealed
event, including on delivery failure and retry.

Loopback and Bazel tests compare effective values against the frozen SDK while
also retaining raw payloads to check placement. Their comparator resolves only
these declared shared fields and rejects numeric/default collisions. Deployed
Agent/intake acceptance remains a separate check.

## Delivery combinations

| Goleak in the selected Mini graph | Deferred delivery | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No | Off | Ordinary batching and asynchronous CI workers. No leak-check checkpoint runs. |
| Yes | Off | Ordinary delivery until `Find` runs; that check waits for sends, pauses new sends, closes owned idle connections and adds exact CI worker filters. |
| No | On | Queue during admitted tests; idle checkpoints deliver full payloads, and the next test waits for that delivery. No goleak filters are installed. |
| Yes | On | Idle delivery plus the same automatic `Find` checkpoint and filters. |

The lightweight HTTP send gate exists in Mini regardless of goleak detection.
Only an instrumented `Find` pauses that gate for leak checking. Deferred delivery
controls when CI work runs; goleak instrumentation controls its leak snapshots.
Neither option ignores leaks or idle connections owned by the tests themselves.

## Maintenance and proof

Review [`cidelivery`](../internal/cidelivery/idle.go),
[`goleak transformation`](../internal/instrument/goleak.go) and
[`library preparation`](../internal/runner/goleak.go) together. If a transformation
changes without changing its generated source, bump its fingerprint contract.
The SDK-port changes are recorded in
[`ADAPTATIONS.md`](../internal/thirdparty/dd-trace-go/ADAPTATIONS.md).

`TestMiniGoleakIntegration` runs ordinary/deferred delivery, external helpers,
invalid options, parallel TestMain, explicit delivery, race and library coverage,
with per-test coverage enabled by the local settings endpoint.
`TestGoleakCacheAndWarmVersionGuard` checks unchanged cache reuse, a changed
goleak source with unrelated standard packages still cached, and rejection of an
unsupported version with unchanged cached source.
`TestDeferredDeliveryParityMatrix` compares 17 CI feature combinations against
the SDK/Orchestrion reference; `TestDeferredDeliveryTestifyParity` adds seven
Testify combinations. Queue tests check order, payload limits, retained failures,
concurrent admission and idempotent release. These are local protocol and behavior
checks; deployed Agent/intake acceptance requires separate evidence.

`TestMiniCoverageWithGlobalTimeChanges` exercises atomic coverage while the test
changes `time.Local`, with 4/32 CPUs and both telemetry/delivery settings. It
compares CI attributes and coverage bitmaps with an SDK run of the same test
paths that leaves the local zone unchanged. Coverage and telemetry lifecycle
tests check worker completion, response draining and startup admission separately.
`TestStartupTelemetryWaitsForIdleGroup` checks first-test admission, initialization
timestamps and configuration, failed-request retry, empty selections and a
concurrent session close against a real loopback HTTP server in both modes.

`TestCommonTagsWireOverridesAndGetters` checks real decoded requests in both
delivery modes. Mixed-snapshot, concurrent sealed-map and byte-accounting checks
live in `internal/minitracer/common_tags_test.go`. The SDK-port tests cover late
updates, direct cached-map edits, Unicode truncation and Bazel filtering.
The [latest runtime comparison](benchmarks.md#runtime-of-the-prebuilt-test-binaries)
records complete test execution, delivery, memory peaks and wire sizes.
