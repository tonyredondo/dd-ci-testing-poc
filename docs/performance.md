# Performance and profiling

Build performance and event-runtime performance have different causes. The
overlay front-end reduces instrumentation work during compilation. Mini reduces
the linked runtime graph and the cost of recording and delivering CI events.
Measure those paths separately.

## Where time goes

```

Runtime work can overlap test execution and can happen when a batch fills.
The diagram names the costs; it is not a timing scale. Compile-only measurements
use `go test -c`, which excludes test execution and event delivery.

| Measurement | Tells you |
| --- | --- |
| Wall time | How long the caller waits, including scheduling and I/O |
| Total CPU time | Work across all participating processes and threads |
| Profile flat time | Samples spent in a function itself |
| Profile cumulative time | Samples in that function and its callees; rows overlap |
| `alloc_space` / B/op | Total bytes allocated, including objects already collected |
| Live heap / aggregate memory peak | Retained memory or simultaneous process memory, depending on the tool |

Profile percentages describe where samples landed. Removing work in a function
can change CPU consumption without producing the same wall-time reduction. Parallel workers can consume many CPU-seconds during one
wall-clock second. Allocation totals are not resident memory. For Orchestrion,
include its daemon and nested builds in CPU and memory accounting; direct-child
process accounting can miss them.

## Front-end optimizations in the code

[`Transform`](../internal/instrument/transform.go) uses the standard Go AST,
skips parser object resolution and applies source-position edits. There is no
DST decoration or type-checking pass in this front-end. Files are sorted for a
deterministic transformation, and unchanged files do not become overlay outputs.

[`PrepareRuntime`](../internal/runner/run.go) requests only the package fields
it needs from a targeted `go list`. Testify discovery can add one metadata or
dependency query, as described below. Both queries decode JSON directly from
Go's stdout. The front-end retains decoded package records without a second
complete JSON buffer. It drains and waits for the subprocess even after malformed
output; command failures and their stderr take precedence over partial JSON.

Rewritten-source buffers reserve the final size, including line directives and
inserted advice. Testify preparation parses each selected library file once and
uses that AST for its API/collision checks and entry rewrite. Covered compiler
inputs have different bytes and receive their own validation.

Generated files are immutable and shared by identical content within one plan.
Many packages with the same package name can share an import-only backing file.
The logical overlay entry still exists for every selected package, so metadata
and conflict checks remain correct. Memory, overlay entries and package
discovery can still grow with package count.

This sharing ends when the plan is removed. The POC uses Go's caches and has no
persistent cache of instrumented binaries or prepared overlays.

## Testify discovery and tool overhead

The [Testify contract](testify.md) selects `-toolexec` from actual reachability,
not the presence of a module requirement. Plain tests and assert-only targets
omit it unless Mini reaches goleak or coverage includes rewritten `testing`
sources. Known library reachability without unknown test imports uses
`go list -find`; unknown test imports use `-deps`
so external helpers remain covered. The selected-version/API check stays in
preparation, before a warm cache can skip the compiler. The dependency query
excludes selected packages and dependency closures already inspected by the
first query. Unknown test-only imports stay in the query, including standard
packages outside those known closures and helpers in other modules. Runtime
dependencies are not evidence of a client's test-helper graph. Suite reachability
is checked before pruning, so a known suite still receives its metadata query
and version validation.

Unrelated tools dispatch without opening the plan. On Unix the CLI replaces
itself with the native tool; Windows delegates through a child. Process startup
still has a cost even when dispatch does little work. The [latest build matrix](benchmarks.md)
measures the complete invocation, including preparation and tool processes.

Selected-version validation must run before compilation: cached archives can
remain usable when vendor metadata changes but source bytes do not.
[`TestTestifyVersionGuardWithWarmVendoredSources`](../integration/vendor_cache_test.go)
checks that case. Testify and goleak share the lookup; both libraries' versions
and APIs are validated even on an unchanged build.

Compiler/linker version identities stay native. The exported suite fingerprint
in `testing` carries instrumentation inputs into Go's package keys. Go owns
compiled-object and test-result caching. Coverage of rewritten `testing` sources
has its own versioned bridge; ordinary client-only coverage needs no bridge.

Goleak has a package-scoped compiler flag marker because it does not import
`testing`. Its worker filters and connection checkpoint are described in
[delivery and goleak](delivery.md).

## Enqueue and delivery

The ordinary enqueue path records its deadline but creates a context/timer only
when it must wait for the send token or flush. Both operations share the original
deadline. This removes timer allocations for events that fit the current batch;
it does not extend a blocked enqueue's timeout.

Mini's test-cycle gzip pool uses `gzip.BestSpeed`. Agentless payloads remain gzip
and obey the same uncompressed intake limit. Coverage and diagnostic-log
compressors retain their SDK settings. Compression ratio depends on payload
shape; compare both CPU and wire size when changing the level.

The optional deferred mode is intended for test isolation, not as a throughput
claim. It delays delivery until idle and permits queue growth across parallel
groups. The [delivery contract](delivery.md) describes that tradeoff.

The source rewriter preserves comment bytes without constructing comment ASTs;
it handles line directives separately. Preparation runs sequentially. The
[build comparison](benchmarks.md) measures its cost as part of the complete CLI
invocation.

## Mini runtime optimizations

| Change | Cost removed or reduced | Constraint to retain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CI-only runtime graph | Compilation/linking of excluded APM components | Retain CI policies, coverage, metadata and telemetry |
| Sealed span maps | Metadata and metric snapshots on `Finish` | Setters must never mutate a finished span's maps |
| Shared CI tag snapshots and cached options | Per-span closures, common map entries and repeated wire strings | Preserve late updates, getters, option precedence, numeric overrides, child spans and Bazel filtering |
| Metadata capacity estimate | Repeated map growth while applying common tags | Include per-event and client tags in the estimate |
| Lazy metric maps | A map allocation for events without numeric metrics | Tag type transitions must retain their existing semantics |
| Direct event encoding | An intermediate encoded event array and its payload copy | Preserve field names, event versions and byte limits |
| Queue and payload reuse | Fresh backing storage after every successful batch | Retryable flush failures retain events; final closure discards a failed batch once |
| Gzip writer and buffer pooling | New compression state for each agentless batch | Seal all request readers before returning storage to a pool |
| Bounded buffer retention | Long-lived oversized buffers after large payloads | Payload and gzip capacities above 2.5 MiB are discarded |
| Standard-library telemetry maps | An external concurrent-map module | Preserve registration, startup replay and log counts under concurrency |
| Bound ordinary CI counters | Repeated tag slices, key joining and registry lookup | Preserve startup replay, client swaps, disabled telemetry and feature-tag fallback |
| Inline metric points | A heap allocation on every count/gauge submission | Collect each value/timestamp together; retain zero, NaN, reset and rate semantics |
| Literal Testify prefix check | Compiling `^Test` for each suite method | Match exactly the same method names |
| Source parser without object resolution | Unused identifier objects in metadata lookup | Retain ITR comments, function ranges and parse errors |
| Direct high trace-ID hex encoding | General-purpose integer formatting | Retain 16 lowercase hex digits, including leading zeros |
| Lazy classification tries | Eager construction of stack-prefix tables | Preserve internal filtering, third-party matching and redaction; publish immutable tries once |
| Internal codec/platform subsets | External runtime module requirements | Preserve original semantics, licenses and source provenance |

Copying a codec into the repository does not itself make its encoder faster.
The dependency reduction comes from changing the runtime graph; the allocation
changes come from event ownership and buffer reuse. Test-only `testify` (v1.7.5)
and its dependencies remain in the repository without entering Mini's runtime
imports.

The [runtime comparison](benchmarks.md#runtime-of-the-prebuilt-test-binaries)
includes startup, test execution and delivery. Its detailed report records
event counts and wire bytes. It measures the complete implementation. Use focused
profiles and controlled comparisons to attribute a change to one optimization.

The SDK-specific implementation rules are recorded in
[ADAPTATIONS.md](../internal/thirdparty/dd-trace-go/ADAPTATIONS.md). Common
lifecycle counters keep bound handles only for the existing framework/hierarchy
tag combinations. Events with retry, EFD, quarantine or other extra tags use the
general registry path. `MockClient` resets invalidate a binding; normal client
swaps retain the existing swappable handle.

Counts and gauges keep their value/timestamp inline under a short mutex. A flush
detaches the whole point under that mutex, then encodes it after releasing the
lock. This removes per-submission snapshots while preserving collection boundaries.

## The ownership rules behind reuse

Read [the event lifetime](architecture.md#native-event-ownership) before changing
`Finish`. The client copies caller-owned configuration at construction. A span
then owns private maps until it seals them; getters continue to work after
finalization. Hierarchy IDs are stored outside those maps so serialization can
write the CI fields without deleting tags.

Delivery owns one reusable payload buffer under `sendMu`. The transport borrows
its bytes only for the duration of `Send`. In agentless mode it borrows a gzip
compressor and buffer too. Request and replay readers must all become unable to
read before either backing buffer is reusable. Calling `Close` on just the
initial reader does not establish that boundary.

In ordinary delivery, the queue is bounded by event count and byte estimates.
A stalled flush can block finishing goroutines and reject new events when an older full batch
cannot be delivered. That is observable backpressure, so a throughput change
must check errors and drops as well as ns/op.

Deferred delivery can buffer more than one batch while tests are active. Its
pending queue has no total size limit; each outgoing payload still obeys the
intake bounds. Include peak memory when assessing that mode.

`Client.add` records a deadline from `FlushTimeout` (10 seconds by default).
It creates a timeout context only if it must wait for the delivery token or
flush a batch. Waiting and flushing share that deadline. Expiry rejects the
incoming event, increments `DroppedEvents` and records the error. An ordinary
enqueue that fits the current batch allocates no timeout context or timer.

[Sealed-span tests](../internal/minitracer/sealed_span_test.go),
[batching tests](../internal/minitracer/batching_test.go),
[queue/concurrency tests](../internal/minitracer/client_test.go) and
[transport reuse tests](../internal/citransport/reuse_test.go) exercise these
contracts. Preserve them when changing synchronization or pooling.

Common CI/Git/OS/runtime strings live in an immutable snapshot shared by spans.
Each span stores only its own tags, metrics and overrides. Getters check local
values before the snapshot. A numeric metric masks a shared string with the same
key; later text can replace that metric. Delivery puts compatible defaults in
payload metadata. Mixed snapshots and overridden keys use local values without
changing the effective CI attributes. See the
[metadata contract](delivery.md#payload-level-common-metadata) for fallback and
byte-accounting rules.

The pooled test-cycle compressor uses `gzip.BestSpeed`. It produces standard
gzip with less compression work and potentially more wire bytes. Coverage and
log writers keep their own SDK compression settings. Compare CPU and transmitted
bytes when changing this level; decoded content and intake limits must remain
unchanged.

## Profiling the native event path

The existing `BenchmarkEventLifecycle` creates and finishes events with common
CI tags. Its HTTP transport consumes requests in memory. The agentless variant
still performs gzip, but neither variant measures real network latency, CI
policy startup or full test execution.

From the repository root, choose a new directory for the artifacts:

```sh
PROFILE_DIR="$(mktemp -d /var/tmp/dd-ci-event-profile.XXXXXX)"

GOMAXPROCS=1 go test ./internal/minitracer -run '^$' \
  -bench '^BenchmarkEventLifecycle/gzip=false$' -benchtime=10s -count=1 -benchmem \
  -cpuprofile "$PROFILE_DIR/serial.cpu.pprof" \
  -memprofile "$PROFILE_DIR/serial.heap.pprof" \
  -o "$PROFILE_DIR/minitracer.test"

go tool pprof -top "$PROFILE_DIR/minitracer.test" "$PROFILE_DIR/serial.cpu.pprof"
go tool pprof -top -cum "$PROFILE_DIR/minitracer.test" "$PROFILE_DIR/serial.cpu.pprof"
go tool pprof -top -sample_index=alloc_space \
  "$PROFILE_DIR/minitracer.test" "$PROFILE_DIR/serial.heap.pprof"
```

Repeat with `gzip=true` and different artifact names to isolate the compression
path. This benchmark runs a serial loop. Raising `GOMAXPROCS` does not turn it
into a parallel producer benchmark; concurrent finish behavior needs a workload
that actually starts concurrent producers. The race/concurrency tests establish
correctness, not throughput.

A CPU profiler inside the test binary does not profile Go's compiler and linker.
For build diagnosis, capture the Go subprocesses and their process tree, or use
`-x` and a Go build trace where available. `go test -cpuprofile` profiles test
execution and should not be used as evidence about a `-c` build's CPU cost.

## Compile-only comparisons

Use four variants: native Go, Orchestrion with the pinned testing aspects,
POC SDK and POC Mini. Fix the project revision, module graph, SDK reference,
toolchain, flags and output layout before timing. Build the CLI and reference
instrumentator outside the timed commands.

For example, after preparing each target module and output directory:

```sh
GOMAXPROCS=4 go test -p=4 -c -o ./out/native/ -ldflags=-w ./...
GOMAXPROCS=4 /path/to/ddtest test --runtime=sdk -p=4 -c -o ./out/sdk/ -ldflags=-w ./...
GOMAXPROCS=4 /path/to/ddtest test --runtime=mini -p=4 -c -o ./out/mini/ -ldflags=-w ./...
GOMAXPROCS=4 go test -p=4 -c -o ./out/orchestrion/ \
  -toolexec="/path/to/orchestrion toolexec" -ldflags=-w ./...
```

The Mini fixture must require this POC module; the SDK fixtures must require the
pinned SDK. Orchestrion must load the SDK's testing-only configuration. Match
the native project's effective dependency inputs across variants and record
any graph additions made for comparison tooling.

Define the scenario before interpreting its result:

| Scenario | Cache and output condition |
| --- | --- |
| Cold build | Independent empty build cache per variant and no output binary; downloaded modules and OS page cache may still be warm |
| Unchanged build | Reuse that variant's cache and existing output binary |
| Forced link | Reuse compiled dependencies and set a fresh linker `-buildid` for each repetition |
| Real edit | Change the same executed test or application body for every variant, retaining its own cache |

Forcing a link measures more than the linker: Go planning, CLI preparation and
generated-main compilation can still contribute. A real-edit scenario must
change an executed test or application body; comment and unused-constant edits
belong in separate diagnostic scenarios. Keep separate output paths so one
variant cannot overwrite another's reusable binary.

An empty `GOCACHE` alone does not establish a cold link: an existing output
binary can let Go skip it. Remove only the experiment's output before each cold
observation, then inspect `-x` for actual compiler and linker invocations. Check
unique edits also compile; keep comment/unused-constant diagnostics distinct
from reachable body edits.

Alternate order, retain every sample and add native-versus-native controls.
Record CPU affinity, `GOMAXPROCS`, `-p`, SMT use and other host workloads.
Report medians with ranges and repetition counts; do not delete slow runs.
Agree on time/run/disk limits before a large matrix.

For a POC table cell, put the signed percentage relative to Orchestrion first,
then the overhead relative to native:

```text
100 * (POC / Orchestrion - 1)
100 * (POC / Native - 1)
Example format: 1.20 s (-40.0% vs Orchestrion; +20.0% vs Native)
```

The example is arithmetic, not a measurement. Compute percentages from
unrounded medians. A negative first value means the POC took less time than
Orchestrion; a positive second value means it took more time than native.

The [build benchmark guide](build-benchmarks.md) documents
[`scripts/build_benchmark.py`](../scripts/build_benchmark.py), which runs all four
variants across the five scenarios, assigns affinity, measures exclusive cgroups
and qualifies the outputs. Its `report` command regenerates the
[latest build tables](results/20261005-linux-go1.27.1/build/README.md)
from every retained CSV observation, without Go or network access.

## Evidence and remaining work

The [latest comparison](benchmarks.md) covers all four variants, Gin/Chi,
direct and external Testify, race and coverage at 4/32 CPUs. It keeps raw
durations, aggregate cgroup memory, variation and event counts, and separates
the unused-constant diagnostic from the reachable test-body edit. All build
cells qualified; four Gin race runtime cells contain real failures. The repeated
115-case parity suite passes, which does not close those application races.

Further profiling can examine MessagePack encoding, tag construction, telemetry
lookups and time spent waiting for `sendMu`. A proposed change needs before/after
measurements on its affected path, plus the compatibility tests that protect its
ownership and wire behavior. Linker experiments and a persistent binary cache
are not part of the current implementation.
