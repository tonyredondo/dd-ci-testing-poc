# Native CI event client

This is POC-owned code, separate from the SDK extraction. The CI wire schema
is adapted from `ddtrace/tracer/civisibility_tslv.go` at the base recorded in
[`../thirdparty/dd-trace-go/SOURCE.json`](../thirdparty/dd-trace-go/SOURCE.json).
Its original Apache-2.0 license and notices are retained there.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `client.go` | Explicit configuration, immutable common metadata, client construction |
| `batch.go` | Bounded queue, byte accounting, serialization, flush/close and error state |
| `runtime.go` | Environment configuration and the process-wide client used by testing hooks |
| `span.go` | Mutable event fields until Finish, CI identity and read-only final maps |
| `common_tags.go` | Immutable CI strings, effective byte accounting and event-kind metadata projection |
| `events.go` | CI-only wire schema; generated serialization lives in `events_msgp.go` |

`Finish` transfers ownership of the private metadata/metric maps once; setters
cannot change them afterward. `sendMu` serializes delivery and owns the reusable
payload buffer. `mu` protects queue/error state; failed delivery keeps the older
batch and rejects new work when bounds would be exceeded. `Close` prevents new
events before the final flush. Readers are sealed by `citransport` before buffers
or compressors are reused. Keep these invariants together when changing code;
the ownership, failed-delivery and race tests cover the consuming paths.

The SDK port binds common CI/Git/system strings once per snapshot revision.
Spans retain that read-only base and their own overrides. Getters check local
text/metrics first; delivery lifts compatible defaults without mutating either
map. An overridden key falls back to local strings for peers, so a masked value
cannot consume the event's byte budget. Mixed snapshots fall back per event kind.
Generic child spans receive no CI defaults. See
[the metadata contract](../../docs/delivery.md#payload-level-common-metadata).

The [architecture guide](../../docs/architecture.md#native-event-ownership)
shows the event and delivery lifetimes. The
[performance guide](../../docs/performance.md#the-ownership-rules-behind-reuse)
explains the allocation changes and the constraints behind buffer reuse.

No APM sampler, security, profiling or remote configuration is hosted here.
An explicit client does not inherit process-global environment configuration.
Changing this code does not update upstream copies automatically; see the
[shared source update procedure](../thirdparty/README.md).
