# philhofer/fwd source subset

- Repository: https://github.com/philhofer/fwd
- Version: `v1.2.0`
- Commit: `20a13a1f6b7cb47a126dcb75152e21e1383bbaba`
- Original license: [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
- File/source hashes and local adaptations: [SOURCE.json](SOURCE.json).

MessagePack encoding and decoding use this subset's buffered reader and writer.
The sources and tests keep their upstream filenames and root package layout.
Mini imports this internal copy without requiring the external module.

Follow the [shared audit and update procedure](../README.md#audit-and-update).

The root module keeps Go 1.21 language rules without changing the consumer.
Adapt newer syntax with ordinary loops and the small standard-library helpers
in `internal/compat`. Keep captured loop values local. Native API and feature
test version guards stay at their boundaries; avoid adding a version constraint
to every source file. Record adaptations and local hashes when updating sources.
