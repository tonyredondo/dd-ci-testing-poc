# Build, runtime and memory comparisons

POC Mini was measured on {mini['started_at'][:10]} at `{mini['source_head']}`.
Native and Orchestrion retain the observations from {reference['started_at'][:10]}
at `{reference['source_head']}`. They were not rerun.
All variants use `{manifest['toolchain']}` and the recorded subject versions,
flags, CPU affinity and repetition counts. The host is an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X:
four CPUs use four physical cores; 32 use all hardware threads.

The comparison contains {build_stats['measured_observations']:,} measured builds,
24 subject/flag combinations and 4/32 CPUs. Mini's 48 build cells passed traces
and binary qualification. The references keep their original qualification.
Runtime validation passes for every variant and repetition in {verified}/{len(runtime)} cells.
Mini completed {mini_attempted} runs with {mini_failed} execution or contract failures.
Another {mini_unverified} runs lack a valid historical SDK event reference; their
observed times, CPU and memory remain in the runtime report. Historical Orchestrion
race failures are also retained.

All time cells are medians in seconds. Mini's percentages compare total
Orchestrion time first, then Native. For example, `(-50%; +20%)` means half
Orchestrion's time and 20% more than Native's. Memory uses aggregate cgroup MiB.
The records keep CPU time, ranges, repetitions, failures and median uncertainty.
No slow observations are removed. Collection dates differ; a small difference
in wall time alone does not establish a stable gain.

# Build, runtime and memory comparisons

This is the 2026-10-04/05 Linux run, measured at POC commit
`{manifest['source_head']}` with `{manifest['toolchain']}`.
The measurements are tied to that revision. The
[validation guide](validation.md) describes the current compatibility checks.
The SDK is `{manifest['sdk_version']}` (commit `{manifest['sdk_commit']}`);
Orchestrion is `{manifest['orchestrion_version']}`.
The host is an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X: four CPUs bind four physical cores;
32 CPUs use all hardware threads of its 16 cores.

The run contains {build_stats['measured_observations']:,} comparative builds
({build_stats['completed_commands']:,} commands including controls and qualification),
1,200 measured runtime groups after 240 warmups, and 115 parity cases repeated
six times at each CPU count. All 48 build cells are qualified. Runtime compatibility
passes in 44 of 48 cells; four Gin race combinations have real failures.

All time cells are medians in **seconds**. POC percentages show the signed change
against total Orchestrion time first, then Native. `(-50%; +20%)` means half
Orchestrion time and 20% more than Native. Positive first values remain positive.
The excerpts below use no extra flags; the linked reports include every Testify,
coverage and race combination, all observations, ranges and median uncertainty.
No slow observations were removed.

## Compilation

Commands use `go test -c -o <directory>/ -ldflags=-w ./...`; no test executable
runs during compilation timing. Each variant uses the same sources and module
resolution graph. Orchestrion loads only the SDK's testing aspects.
Cold runs use an empty Go build cache and removed output; downloaded modules and
the OS page cache stay warm. Builds run serially with rotating variant order.
Affinity, `GOMAXPROCS` and `-p` match the CPU column.

Plain Gin/Chi use 5/10/20/10/3 repetitions for cold/cache/link/body-edit/constant-edit.
The other configurations use 3/10/10/5/3. The 160-run Native link control passed
the recorded convergence thresholds. It checks that control's median, rather
than the stability of every matrix cell. Both control datasets are retained.

Gin `-race` and `-race -coverpkg=./... -covermode=atomic` fail at both CPU counts.
`binding.TestMappingTime` writes `time.Local` while SDK background work calls
`time.Now`. The SDK-derived asynchronous coverage processor also exposes the
race in Mini with atomic coverage. Failed or unverified variants have no valid
comparative median. No test was removed and no race detector was disabled.

Passing plain-race Mini runs are checked against identical Native test results
and the successful non-race SDK CI inventory; this fallback is restricted to
cases without coverage. Eleven otherwise passing coverage groups lack a
successful SDK coverage oracle and remain unverified.

Go's default `-covermode=set` produces aggregate Go coverage. The pinned SDK
and Mini support per-test uploads only in count/atomic modes. Runtime eligibility
uses the validated classifications in the archive; the raw records retain every
observation and classification for audit.
Gin atomic coverage takes about 6.5–6.9 seconds in the instrumented variants;
these build improvements do not eliminate that runtime cost. Chi's full suite
takes about 26 seconds even in Native, so its overall runtime hides small SDK costs.

## Repeated CI parity

All 1,380 scenario comparisons passed, plus the manual, additional-span,
multi-package, fuzz, telemetry, Unix Agent and goleak fixtures in every round.
The 65-case testing and 17-case deferred blocks each use a continuous clock,
including receiver setup and child shutdown but excluding compilation and
comparison. Three rounds run SDK first and three run Mini first at each CPU count.
The 26 Testify and seven deferred Testify cases use paired SDK-first order;
their race-runtime shutdown delays account for about 33 seconds of the full
115-case child-clock sum. That sum is not a continuous wall-time measurement.
The [per-case report]({link}/parity/README.md) keeps the event counts and ranges.
We did not collect separate SDK/Mini memory peaks for those individual cases;
the runtime memory matrix above measures complete project test groups.
